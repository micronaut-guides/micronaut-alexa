In this tutorial we are going to build and deploy an Amazon Alexa skill using Micronaut to AWS.

* `alexa-star-wars-quiz` - A Function which you will build with Micronaut and deploy to https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda].


The next diagram illustrates the flow of an Alexa skill:

We will be building a full featured Amazon Alexa Skill in Groovy using Micronaut that uses DynamoDB data storage. This uses the newer V2 ASK SDK.

If you want to try in Java or Kotlin, try to modify the code as we go and give it a shot!

Deploy your Micronaut function to https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda].

First, make sure you have your AWS Credentials configured, and you have an IAM Role for running the AWS Lambda with access to DynamoDB.

The easiest way to configure credentials for invoking the function is to define a ~/.aws/credentials` file`.

[source,bash]
----
[default]
aws_access_key_id=XXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key=XXXXX
----

You can create the access key under the user in IAM console. Don't lose your key, if you do you will have to delete it and create a new one.


If you have not deployed a Lambda function before you might not have the proper roles configured. Make sure you have the role `lambda_basic_execution`
under IAM roles. If you don't, let's create one, or it will create one the first time you make one in the Lambda console. This is the rights your lambda will
have while it is running - that way you don't hard-code any sort of access credentials into your code. Micronaut will find them for you!

Create the role:

Now attach the policy:

Now let's edit the build.gradle and set the role name (If you created the role named `lambda_basic_execution` you will not need to change this.

[source,groovy]
----
if(new File("${System.getProperty("user.home")}/.aws/credentials").exists()) {
    task deploy(type: jp.classmethod.aws.gradle.lambda.AWSLambdaMigrateFunctionTask, dependsOn: shadowJar) {
        functionName = "micronaut-starWarsQuiz" // <1>
        handler = "io.micronaut.function.aws.alexa.AlexaFunction" // <2>
        role = "arn:aws:iam::${aws.accountId}:role/lambda_basic_execution" // <3>
        runtime = com.amazonaws.services.lambda.model.Runtime.Java8
        zipFile = shadowJar.archivePath
        memorySize = 512 // <4>
        timeout = 60 // <5>
    }

}
----
<1> name of function - this doesn't matter but use something you can find easily in your Lambda console
<2> handler of function - use the main class in this case AlexaFunction
<3> role the Lambda will execute as
<4> tip: the more memory you give a function running Java, the faster it starts
<5> function must finish execution in 60 seconds or it will be killed



Now we are ready to deploy! run the deploy command:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew deploy
----

If successful, you should see something like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew deploy
